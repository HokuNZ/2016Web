							<h2>Emily</h2>
							<p>We've had a fantastic time in France. The boys both love skiing, and Jacob has mostly recovered from breaking his bones last year, despite a tentative start. We got lots of snow, so had our first real experience of skiing in proper powder snow - fun to ski, and even more fun watching Kieran ski through snow up to his waist. If I can suppress my maternal instincts enough, it’s great watching them try out jumps and zip through trees. I’m definitely holding the boys back on the slopes now, but they’re generous about it, usually.</p>
							<p>We covered a lot of ground over the fortnight. The 3 Vallees bills itself as the largest ski area in the world, and it felt like it. But we got to the farthest points, and the highest and lowest points, encouraged by the opportunity to earn “Escapades” badges along the way and the promise of a certificate when we’d got them all. And then we ran out of time to actually get the certificate before we left!</p>
							<p>All that skiing meant I’ve improved a lot. I didn’t start skiing until relatively late, and had a bad crash early on which set me back. But having some lessons in NZ and a couple of fortnights away and my skill and confidence have really come along. I also burnt a lot of calories, but Cat, our wonderful chalet host, made sure I wasn’t in calorie deficit at the end of the day. Between her and the crew of the ship we went to Antarctica on, I’ve been totally spoilt at the start of our trip, and I will miss being looked after.</p>
							<p>My highlight, though, was definitely trying skijoring, which I’ve been fascinated with since I read an article about it a couple of years ago. For those who don’t know, it’s basically being towed along on skis behind a horse (or dogs!). One version of it has a rider on the horse, and the skier being towed on a rope and having to collect rings and jump jumps, a little like waterskiing. We did a slightly more sedate version, where we were basically the sledge behind the horse and steered with long reins. Didn’t have a whole lot of control, especially when Okies decided he didn’t want to be last in the queue up the hill and took off, but we all enjoyed it immensely.</p>
							<p>We were all sad to leave Meribel (especially as there was another big dump of snow as we were leaving) but we will no doubt be back in future years. The boys already have a list of runs they want to ski when we do.</p>
							
							<h2>Kieran</h2>
								<p>Well... France has been the best experience ever for me, so I've improved a lot in skiing and Hopscotch (which is an iPad app with easy coding like scratch but with less blocks and the blocks are easier to under stand). But its been a blast here in France and Switzerland.</p>
								<p>I made a snow man and it eventually turned into a lump of snow on our balcony but it did look pretty cool, but the main reason we came here was to ski!!!!!!!!</p>
								<p>My favourite bit was doing my first full black run (the colours are <strong style="color:green">green</strong>, <strong style="color:darkblue">blue</strong>, <strong style="color:red">red</strong> and <strong style="color:black">black</strong>, for <strong style="color:green">beginners</strong>, <strong style="color:darkblue">easy</strong>, <strong style="color:red">hard</strong> and <strong style="color:black">extra hard</strong>, there is also the Vertical Xperience which is basically at the steepest it is 80 degree incline, but we didn’t do that because you have to be over 21 to be able to do it).</p>
								<p>My least favourite bit is when I had a massive crash at the bottom of the run called col. That was definitely the best crash that any of us had skiing.</p>
								<p>It was sad leaving Meribel, so I'll leave at that and I’l talk again in my Spain post.</p>
