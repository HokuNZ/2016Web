							<p>When we went to Disney World, the first place we went to was the Magic Kingdom, and the first place there was Tomorrowland. We went straight to Space Mountain. It was so cool because you went on a roller coaster in the dark. It was really cool. It was the best ride we went on there. Then we went to Frontierland and we went on Splash Mountain. I was sitting next to grandad so I had to hold onto the bar so I didn't fly off into space because his legs were too big.</p>
							<p>The second park we went to was Hollywood studios. Grandma and grandad were too chicken to go on the Tower of Terror, but they did go on the the Rock-n-Roller coaster because the description was hop in a stretch limo and ride through the streets of Hollywood. But the when we went on it, we were in a superstretch limo that went really fast from standstill and they were scared. We also went to the Star Wars launch pad about a million times because they had a game we could play.</p>
							<p>On grandmas birthday we went to Animal Kingdom. The best bit was Dinoland because it was fun. Everything else was a bit boring. We dug for fossils and found at wooly mammoth. Grandma and grandad liked Animal Kingdom because everything there was slow moving.</p>
							<p>Before we left the USA we also went to the Kennedy space center. NASA is planning to go to Mars and we did a virtual reality walk on Mars. We saw the Saturn V rocket which went to the moon and the shuttle Atlantis. It was really awesome. If you go to Disney World, take a day to go to the space center.</p>

							<p>I’m not going to lie - when we first made a list of all of the places we wanted to visit this year neither Orlando, Florida or Nashville, Tennessee were on it. But nonetheless we ended up here, and for different reasons we’re going to remember this little interlude of our trip quite fondly.</p>
							<p>After our fortnight together in Mexico, Mum and Dad offered to take the boys for an adventure to Walt Disney World in Orlando, while Emily and I escaped to Nashville, where we spent a relaxing and rejuvenating couple of days hanging out with our old friends, Geoff and Ange (actually, they are not that old! ;-). We took in some local sights, sounds and tastes (the sounds of Nashville are much more widely known and appreciated, unless chicken fried chicken is your thing). But mostly we just enjoyed catching up, sharing some stories of the trip so far and reminiscing about former lives in Wellington.</p>
							<p>Returning to Orlando to collect the boys we managed to squeeze in a full day at the NASA Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, where we got to tour the launch pads (checking out the new SpaceX facilities and some of the history from the Apollo missions), take a virtual reality walk around Mars, and then check out the space shuttle Atlantis, now grounded but preserved in it’s original condition and quite amazing to see up close.</p>
							<p>It seems like a life time ago we landed at SFO to mark the end of our time in Asia and the start of our time in America. After detours via Brazil, Cuba and Mexico, this was a fun full stop. Now, Africa...</p>
