							<p>Unlike most of the places we have visited this year, we arrived in London with a pretty good idea of what we wanted to do, thanks to spending three years here before Jacob was born. It was a nice feeling to arrive in a country and know our way about.</p>
							<p>With a month to fill we were keen to do a combination of things we’d done while we lived here, as well as some new experiences. Old favourites included the Tate Modern, Tower of London, Windsor Castle, the V&amp;A, and the National Portrait Gallery, while new experiences included a football game at Wembley, Tower Bridge, and a trip to the North West - the Peak District, Manchester, Yorkshire Dales, and Stratford-upon-Avon. But there are plenty of places we didn’t get to see, especially out of London. Like most of the places we’ve been this year, plenty of things to draw us back!</p>
							<p>I was really impressed with the work the museums and attractions have put into developing materials for families, most of which kept the kids interested until their blood sugar levels ran low and it was time to feed the animals. The backpacks at the V&amp;A and the multimedia tour at the British Museum were particular highlights, while the activity sheet at the Banqueting House turned a place I thought the boys would want to leave after five minutes into somewhere we had to drag them out of. Their parents learned a bit, too.</p>
							<p>We saw a few shows - The Lion King and the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime with the boys, and as a special child-free treat, the opening night of Matthew Bourne’s new ballet, The Red Shoes. All of these were fantastic - wonderful staging and costumes, and beautifully acted/danced/sung, and at least a couple of them brought a lump to my throat. </p>
							<p>And we had a few days where we didn’t do much at all, and they were nice, too.</p>

							<p>November/December is not when you would ideally choose to spend a month in London.</p>
							<p>We lasted three winters when we lived here in the early 2000s, each time saying it would be our last. I remember them as overwhelmingly grey and grim. But somehow I'd forgotten the brilliant yellows, oranges and reds. During our time here this time around we saw the leaves go from the final green on the trees to brown slush on the footpaths.</p>
							<p>It at least made for changeable scenery as I revived my affair with running, where I first fell in love with it. There haven't been many opportunities for regular exercise as we've travelled, and some of the cold white mornings in Regents Park made it a bit difficult to get the shoes on, but, as always, I never regretted it once out there. Sadly I didn't get a chance to revisit Finsbury Park track or Richmond Park where I put in so many laps in the past. But, as we've said all year, it's important to always leave some things so you have an excuse to return in the future. </p>
							<p>A month seems like a long time. But not when you pack the days full. We managed to squeeze in lots of sport (England v Spain at a packed Wembley and a much more relaxed behind the scenes tour of Emirates Stadium just a long throw in away from our old flat in Thane Villas), theatre (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nightime on the West End, the world premier of The Red Shoes at Sadlers Wells, plus visits to Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre), art and culture (my old favourites: the National Portrait Gallery and Tate Modern), lots of Londons seemingly endless museums (the V&amp;A, the Churchill War Rooms soaked up an entire wet morning and then some, the brand new Design Museum in Kensington, and the slightly weird Wellcome Institute collection) and some fun odd things too (the slide at the ArcelorMittal Orbit at the London Olympic Park, requiring all of us to wear elbow guards and rugby-style headgear for the ride down, for example). But still we felt like we barely scratched the surface. </p>
							<p>Even so, that's just a list. The really neat part about being in London is just being in London - joining the giant melting pot, minding the gap, reading the papers, navigating the city via the wonderful signage and eating the dodgy curries, experiencing some royal pageantry, riding the underground (although the sleek new Routemaster buses were a bigger hit with the boys), and generally soaking in the history and possibility.</p>
							<p>A big part of our planning for this year was trying to not only travel but also make sure we had plenty of time <em>being</em> in places. We’ve enjoyed visiting many of the great world cities. After a month in New York earlier this year it might have briefly taken the title, but London has made a late comeback. Let’s call it a tie. Either way, I can confidently say it’s not going to be another 10 years before we visit again, and invest some more time here.</p>
